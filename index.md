## 2019-10-31 Helloween printing

Just dug out my 3D printer I bought a year ago (an "Ender 2") and never printed more than a downloaded example dice. Most fun for me was screwing it together. I always wanted to create my own things and print them but did not find the time.

Until today I read about some modelling tools and came across [OpenSCAD](https://www.openscad.org). It's really simple. You create your models exclusively using a scripting language, e.g. for a cube just type:
```
cube([10,20,30]);
```
You can see a simple example (and later maybe even more) of an "Iglu" (igloo) [here](https://github.com/jpstrube/3d-printing-examples).
